iOS GUIDE
=============

## Get started
In order to get started with iOS you will have to obtain a __cert.pem__ and an __key.pem__ for both production and development.
Bellow are some snippets of documentaion:

## Certificates

This is fairly straight forward, for the most parts you are guided in the developer.apple.com console:

1. Create the CSR from keychain
2. Create AppId (enable push)
3. Create push certificates for production and development
4. Create provisioning profiles for the app production and development

This is described bellow:

5. Convert the push certificates into paired `key.pem` and `cert.pem` files
6. Test the `*.pem` files making sure they work
7. Add the `*.pem` files to your `/private` folder in the Meteor app

If you need to learn more about creating certificates you should read the whole [Great writeup by Ali](http://www.raywenderlich.com/32960/apple-push-notification-services-in-ios-6-tutorial-part-1) - Bellow is a short snippet from the blog:

###Making a PEM File
So now you have three files:
* The CSR
* The private key as a p12 file (PushChatKey.p12)
* The SSL certificate, aps_development.cer

Store these three files in a safe place. You could throw away the CSR but in my opinion it is easier to keep it. When your certificate expires, you can use the same CSR to generate a new one. If you were to generate a new CSR, you would also get a new private key. By re-using the CSR you can keep using your existing private key and only the .cer file will change.

You have to convert the certificate and private key into a format that is more usable. Because the push part of our server will be written in PHP, you will combine the certificate and the private key into a single file that uses the PEM format.

The specifics of what PEM is doesn’t really matter (in fact, I have no idea) but it makes it easier for PHP to use the certificate. If you write your push server in another language, these following steps may not apply to you.

You’re going to use the command-line OpenSSL tools for this. Open a Terminal and execute the following steps.

Go to the folder where you downloaded the files, in my case the Desktop:
```
$ cd ~/Desktop/
```
Convert the .cer file into a .pem file:
```
$ openssl x509 -in aps_development.cer -inform der -out PushChatCert.pem
```
Convert the private key’s .p12 file into a .pem file:
```
$ openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out PushChatKey.pem -in PushChatKey.p12
Enter Import Password: 
MAC verified OK
Enter PEM pass phrase: 
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: 
```
You first need to enter the passphrase for the .p12 file so that openssl can read it. Then you need to enter a new passphrase that will be used to encrypt the PEM file. Again for this tutorial I used “pushchat” as the PEM passphrase. You should choose something more secure.
Note: if you don’t enter a PEM passphrase, openssl will not give an error message but the generated .pem file will not have the private key in it.
Finally, combine the certificate and key into a single .pem file:
```
$ cat PushChatCert.pem PushChatKey.pem > ck.pem
```
At this point it’s a good idea to test whether the certificate works. Execute the following command:
```
$ telnet gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com 2195
Trying 17.172.232.226...
Connected to gateway.sandbox.push-apple.com.akadns.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
This tries to make a regular, unencrypted, connection to the APNS server. If you see the above response, then your Mac can reach APNS. Press Ctrl+C to close the connection. If you get an error message, then make sure your firewall allows outgoing connections on port 2195.
Let’s try connecting again, this time using our SSL certificate and private key to set up a secure connection:
```
$ openssl s_client -connect gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 
    -cert PushChatCert.pem -key PushChatKey.pem
Enter pass phrase for PushChatKey.pem: 
```
You should see a whole bunch of output, which is openssl letting you know what is going on under the hood.
If the connection is successful, you should be able to type a few characters. When you press enter, the server should disconnect. If there was a problem establishing the connection, openssl will give you an error message but you may have to scroll up through the output to find it.

If you get an error from openssl saying:
```
Verify return code: 20 (unable to get local issuer certificate) 
```
Try adding the Entrust Certificate by going here: [Entrust.net](http://www.entrust.net/developer/index.cfm). Click on 'Root Certificate Downloads' on the left hand side then click 'Download Root Certificates' near the bottom of the page. It will ask you to identify a reason for downloading and you can select 'Personal Use and Secure Server Installation' then click 'Download Certificates'. On the next page choose Root Certificates. Find the 
```
entrust_2048_ca.cer
```
Download it and put it into the same location as your PushChatCert.cert and PushChatKey.key. Now add the -CAfile flag and the certificate we just downloaded to try our secure connection again:
```
$ openssl s_client -connect gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 -CAfile entrust_2048_ca.cer -cert PushChatCert.pem -key PushChatKey.pem
```
And you should see the openssl message change to 
```
Verify return code: 0 (ok) 
```
*Note: There are two different APNS servers: the “sandbox” server that you can use for testing, and the live server that you use in production mode. Above, we used the sandbox server because our certificate is intended for development, not production use.*
